## About Me {#about}

Hey there! I'm a second-year Master's student at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/). I graduated from [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) and had the chance to work under [Prof. Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/) in [S-Lab](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/). At CMU, I've been involved with some exciting research at [XuLab](https://xulabs.github.io/) under [Prof. Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/), and I'm actively collaborating with [Dr. Liang Pan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lSDISOcAAAAJ&hl=en) on several research projects.

Right now, I'm focused on some exciting stuff in 3D generation. I'm always up for a good chat, brainstorming session, or potential collaborationâ€”so feel free to connect!
